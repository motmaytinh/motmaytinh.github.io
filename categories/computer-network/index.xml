      <description>I was reading tutorial to setup a VPN to securely connect to my private server a detail catch my attention - WireGuard uses UDP. Up until that time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much of VPN and even more, what does it mean by using UDP, how would application using TCP still work with that VPN.&#xA;So I set sail to study about VPN,&amp;hellip;&#xA;Disclaimer: Please don&amp;rsquo;t take any of these thing as source of truth as I&amp;rsquo;m not expert in computer networking.</description>
