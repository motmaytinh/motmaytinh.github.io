      <description>These are blog posts I read over the years. Some of them explain concepts in a way thatâ€™s easy to understand. Some discuss common pitfalls/misunderstandings which are helpful for a newbie. There are also some blogs that I like to read. They either have witty or neat content.

      <description>If you like to collect wisdom from blogs like me, you probably have experienced when: having too many blogs to follow and not knowing when a new post comes out. The primitive manual way to do is regularly loop through the bookmarked blogs to find if there are any updates. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not the way we developer comply with, most of you will think of writing a crawler, automating the process and notify when new content had been published.</description>
