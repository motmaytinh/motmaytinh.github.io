      <description>If you like to collect wisdom from blogs like me, you probably have experienced when: having too many blogs to follow and not knowing when a new post comes out. The primitive manual way to do is regularly loop through the bookmarked blogs to find if there are any updates. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not the way we developer comply with, most of you will think of writing a crawler, automating the process and notify when new content had been published.</description>

      <description>When working on my thesis, I have to experiment on different tokenize tool. One of those is VnCoreNLP which is reported to have very high accuracy. The thing is it&amp;rsquo;s written in Java while my pipeline is written in Python. So, I decided to write a python wrapper for it. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
FYI: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, the problem of calling others programming language is interoperability. For example, Java can call native function written in C/C++ using JNI.</description>
