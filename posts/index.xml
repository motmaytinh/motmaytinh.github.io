      <description>When working on my thesis, I have to experiment on different tokenize tool. One of those is VnCoreNLP which is reported to have very high accuracy.

FYI: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, the problem of calling others programming language is interoperability. For example, Java can call native function written in C/C++ using JNI.</description>
