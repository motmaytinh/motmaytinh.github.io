Hi, I am a fourth-year B.E student in Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology. I am particularly enthusiastic in exploring NLP and ML techniques to solve realworld problems relating to language technologies.

I am a software engineer at Zalo.

## Personal

I like making friends with people around the world; photography; reading books; listening to instrumental music.
