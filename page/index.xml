      <description>🍵 May 27, 2020
&amp;ldquo;Because it&amp;rsquo;s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That&amp;rsquo;s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible cafe. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that if my dream is realized, I&amp;rsquo;ll have no reason to go on living.&amp;rdquo;
— Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
