      <description>These are blog posts I read over the years. Some of them explain concepts in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand. Some discuss common pitfalls/misunderstandings which are helpful for a newbie. There are also some blogs that I like to read. They either have witty or neat content.
Computer Networking  How NAT traversal works How CDN works Shortest URLs on the Internet HTTP Meme Okay, this is not awesome, it&amp;rsquo;s just a product by me :))  Programming  Explaining dynamic programming to a 4 year old SOLID How to design a delayed scheduler in Java?</description>

      <description>If you like to collect wisdom from blogs like me, you probably have experienced when: having too many blogs to follow and not knowing when a new post comes out. The primitive manual way to do is regularly loop through the bookmarked blogs to find if there are any updates. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not the way we developer comply with, most of you will think of writing a crawler, automating the process and notify when new content had been published.</description>

      <title>How I wrote a python wrapper for Java implementation of VnCoreNLP</title>

      <description>When working on my thesis, I have to experiment with different tokenize tool. One of those is VnCoreNLP which is reported to have very high accuracy. The thing is it&amp;rsquo;s written in Java while my pipeline is written in Python. So, I decided to write a python wrapper for it. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
FYI: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, the problem of calling other programming language is interoperability. For example, Java can call native functions written in C/C++ using JNI.</description>
