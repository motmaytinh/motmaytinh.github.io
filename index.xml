&amp;ldquo;Because it&amp;rsquo;s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That&amp;rsquo;s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible cafe. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid that if my dream is realized, I&amp;rsquo;ll have no reason to go on living.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>When working on my thesis, I have to experiment on different tokenize tool. One of those is VnCoreNLP which is reported to have very high accuracy. The thing is it&amp;rsquo;s written in Java while my pipeline is written in Python. So, I decided to write a python wrapper for it. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.
FYI: If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, the problem of calling others programming language is interoperability. For example, Java can call native function written in C/C++ using JNI.</description>
